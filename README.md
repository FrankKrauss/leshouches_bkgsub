A quick study on the impact of irreducible-background subtraction

Processes to consider:


WW versus ttbar

14 TeV (maybe also 13 TeV), B-tag up to y=2.5 (allowing a veto on b-jets in this region if it helps). Also look at the impact of pseudo-top vetos.

Double leptonic channel:

1. Consider WWjj as the signal. Look at WW scattering-like WWjj topologies. Study the contribution to the signal coming from double-resonant (DR), single-resonant (SR) and continuum (C) ttbar processes, and the sum.

2. Consider WWj or WW as the signal. Look at jet-binning for for all WW (not just the VBS topology). Same study (DR/SR/C/Sum)

3. Consider WWbb as the signal, motivated by WWH (H→bb). Same study (DR/SR/C/Sum).

Semi-leptonic channel:

4. Consider ttbar as signal. Look at distortion in b-lepton mass from SR/C/Sum/WWbb-non-top contributions.


Wb versus t

Link to the ATLAS paper TBD

This would be a nice demo of some of the ideas above with a real measurement. Treat Wb excluding t as the signal, use the ATLAS Wb (unsubstracted) measurement and re-evaluate the single-top subtraction and systematics.
